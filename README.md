# MovieApp
Movie android application that uses MVVM design pattern, Dagger hilt and Room persistence library

I chose MVVM design pattern for this application as it helps seperate UI and Application logic(Business logic). By seperating this two part it will be easier to maintain the application as we can work on different sides simultaneously and wont affect them both that much. This is ideal for huge scope applications as it is easy to implement/update components because of their abstraction.
